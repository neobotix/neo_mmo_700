The omnidirectional [MMO-700](https://www.neobotix-robots.com/products/mobile-manipulators-overview/mobile-manipulator-mmo-700.html) is the ideal base for high-end service robots. It combines the omnidirectional MPO-700 with a light-weight robot arm from Universal Robots, Kuka, Rethink Robotics or Schunk. The MMO-700's four Omni-Drive-Modules create very smooth omnidirectional movements. This is a significant advantage over vehicles with Mecanum wheels when handling or transporting fragile or expensive parts. 

* Fully omnidirectional manoeuvrability
* Very steady movements
* High stability and payload
* Compact, easily integrated drive units

This makes the MMO-700 a premium alternative for applications that require omnidirectional movements without the limitations of traditional kinematics.
